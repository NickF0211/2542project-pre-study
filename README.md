This is a pre-study for our course project proposal "Study interpolation based heuristic for classical planning".
In this example, I manually encode the hallway planning problem into a proposition formula, and use Z3 (verison 4.7.1) for testing 
satisfiability and use iz3 for deriving interpolant. 

To run the file, Download the source from https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases/tag/z3-4.7.1, and then follows
the build instruction to build z3 with python binding!
