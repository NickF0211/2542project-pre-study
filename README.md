This is a pre-study for our course project proposal "Study interpolation based heuristic for classical planning".
In this example, I manually encode the hallway planning problem into a proposition formula, and use Z3 for testing 
satisfiability and compute interpolates from UNSAT core. 

To run the file, install pyz3 from through pip install z3-solver
